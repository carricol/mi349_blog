            <h3>Album: Brat and it's completely different but also still brat</h3>
            <h3>Artist: Charli XCX</h3>
            <h4>Rating: 9/10</h4>
            <h4>Favorite Song: I might say something stupid feat. The 1975 & Jon Hopkins</h4>

                With the beginning of fall, the neon green-coconut tree-360 party girl-ification fueled by Charli XCX’s culture-shifting album “Brat” was thought to be over. But in true fashion, Brat was not a trend, it’s a lifestyle. A brand-new version of Brat has just dropped, titled “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat”, including the same 16 songs from the original album. Or so I thought these were the same 16 songs. Each track now has a featured artist, the likes of which include Ariana Grande, The 1975, Bon Iver, and many others. What I expected was the traditional remix of the original song, with one verse of Charli’s cut out for the featured artist to be included. What I did not expect was that each song had hints of the original, but as the album title suggests, each one was basically an entirely new song. While the original album was giving night club, early 2000s, messy, and unbothered, “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat” felt much softer and more restrained. The very serious and existential lyrics of the original album were easy to miss behind the techno-hyper-pop beats. In this album, they are center-stage, and bring a much different side of Charli XCX to light that, although seems counter-culture to her party girl persona, actually fits with the natural lifecycle of the lifestyle. Brat summer may be over, but Brat fall has just begun.

            <h3>Album: Kansas Anymore</h3>
            <h3>Artist: Role Model</h3>
            <h4>Rating: 6/10</h4>
            <h4>Favorite Song: Slipfast</h4>
            <p>
                Role Model’s alter-ego, the Saint Laurent Cowboy, takes center stage in his latest album “Kansas Anymore”. Through and through, “Kansas Anymore” is a break-up album, recounting the heartbreak and nostalgia of a failed relationship where neither side is really at fault. However, the album feels light, like Role Model has broken through to the other side and can acknowledge the pain of love lost while still respecting the woman and what they had when they were together. There’s the perfect balance of catchy lyrics, upbeat guitar riffs while also allowing for a deeper, emotional connection if the listener wants. As someone who’s been a long-time listener of Role Model, this album differentiates itself with a level of maturity and self-awareness that was lacking from earlier projects of his. There is an obvious influence of trending artists and genres of TikTok and Gen-Z listeners like Noah Kahan, Kacey Musgraves, and even Zach Bryan, which cheapens the album a little bit for me because I think Role Model has such a personality and sound of his own that these influences are in the hopes of getting a “viral hit”. That being said, mixture of songs and their placement throughout the track list is almost formulaic with how good it is. The pacing takes you on a journey, and never leaves you too-high or too-low for too long. Like a yellow brick road, Role Model’s “Kansas Anymore” travels through heartbreak, nostalgia, and acceptance of change that many listeners, myself included, can relate to and appreciate.
