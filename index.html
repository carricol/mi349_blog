            <h3>Album: Brat and it's completely different but also still brat</h3>
            <h3>Artist: Charli XCX</h3>
            <h4>Rating: 10/10</h4>
            <p>
                With the beginning of fall, the neon green-coconut tree-360 party girl-ification fueled by Charli XCX’s culture-shifting album “Brat” was thought to be over. But in true fashion, Brat was not a trend, it’s a lifestyle. A brand-new version of Brat has just dropped, titled “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat”, including the same 16 songs from the original album. Or so I thought these were the same 16 songs. Each track now has a featured artist, the likes of which include Ariana Grande, The 1975, Bon Iver, and many others. What I expected was the traditional remix of the original song, with one verse of Charli’s cut out for the featured artist to be included. What I did not expect was that each song had hints of the original, but as the album title suggests, each one was basically an entirely new song. While the original album was giving night club, early 2000s, messy, and unbothered, “Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat” felt much softer and more restrained. The very serious and existential lyrics of the original album were easy to miss behind the techno-hyper-pop beats. In this album, they are center-stage, and bring a much different side of Charli XCX to light that, although seems counter-culture to her party girl persona, actually fits with the natural lifecycle of the lifestyle. Brat summer may be over, but Brat fall has just begun.
