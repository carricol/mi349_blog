                Hello! Welcome to my blog related to all things music, specifically new releases. On the surface, nothing about me screams “Music Expert” or gives me the qualifications to be a music reviewer, and in all honesty, that is pretty accurate. Besides the few years of piano lessons and middle school choir, I have no formal music education. Although I can operate a soundboard, my knowledge of music production stops after that.  So, why should you care about what I have to say? Well, I think what I lack in qualifications I make up for in passion and commitment. There are very few times throughout the day when I don’t have music playing. It’s not just background music, it’s a soundtrack to my life’s moments. Most of my everyday listening isn’t current (think 70’s-90’s range), and although I do believe that most good music was made then, there are still so many good artists and albums being produced today. I’ve begun to make an effort to seek these new tunes out and give them the time and listening ears they deserve. So, as you read about my opinions, you may not find technical breakdowns or in-depth analyses of the production quality or lyrical intelligence, but you will find appreciation for the world these artists curate in their music, and the experience they bring their listeners through their production. So, sit back, throw on some music, and dive deep into my personal, very (not) professional views on the latest music of today.
